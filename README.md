This year the world was hit by a pandemic which has the potential to completely revamp the business work culture. With everyone but the most essential people working from home, businesses have had to find a way to continue being productive. With this project I hope to study how much of an impact working from home has had tech companies in the united states. I first want to look at just how much business travel/ road commuting have gone down. I then would like to find a way to measure tech firms productivity, I am currently thinking of doing this by measuring version history of the top 100 or so apps this year vs previous years. I would then like to measure the revenue/profit numbers of those companies vs the top 100 non tech companies for this year vs previous years. I would also like to find the number of employees those companies laid off if possible. I think that I will find that these companies are faring much better and have not lost much productivity. I am thinking of using api calls, json, dataframes and sql to fetch data clean out what I need and load it all into tables in mysql. I then want to incorporate them into a notebook for easy visualization, possibly apache zepplin.
