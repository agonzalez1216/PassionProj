This year the world was hit by a pandemic which has the potential to completely revamp the business work culture. With everyone but the most essential people working from home, businesses have had to find a way to continue being productive. With this project I hope to study how much of an impact working from home has had tech companies in the United States. First, I want to look at just how much business travel/road commuting have gone down. Then, I would like to find a way to measure tech firms productivity. I plan on doing this by measuring version history of the top ~100 apps this year vs previous years. I would then like to measure the revenue/profit numbers of those companies vs the top 100 non-tech companies for this year vs previous years. If possuble, I would also like to find the number of employees those companies laid off. I predict that I will find that these companies are faring much better and have not lost much productivity. I am thinking of using api calls, json, dataframes and sql to fetch data clean out what I need and load it all into tables in mysql. I then want to incorporate them into a notebook for easy visualization, possibly apache zepplin.
